Allebone.Me - Project Two Repository
===================


Greetings.  I'm Bryan, and this is the Repository for my Project Two (and ultimately the site that holds the links to my future projects.  **[Github](http://www.Github.com)** will contain the most up-to-date Commits for this project.

##**[http://p2.allebone.me](http://p2.allebone.me)**


> **Note:**

> - All of the links and necessary resources are hosted within a Digital Ocean Droplet at the above link (and requisite sub folders). Additionally, the DNS Name Services are provided through the educational assistance program of NameCheap.com. I chose to allow NameCheap to continue to maintain the Name Server control (of forwarding) for the time being, as I didn't want to complicate matters with propagation delay.

Project Description
-------------------

As a class requirement, this project and all subsequent projects will be Version Controlled via Git and Github. The link above will lead you my very first Project whose purpose and role is to provide links to the future projects and tell you a little about myself.  I'll let that site do that, instead of elaborating here, but some features I'd like to highlight. There is a quick-navigation menu on the right which can be opened by button and closed via "X" button. This will lead to anchored sections within the overall document, making it a single continous flowing page. 


Demo Information
--------------------

This project doesn't have a demo requirement, but I wanted to include the block I will utilize to store the location for future projects.  

> **Presentation:** My Demo can be found at [Demo Place](http://p1.allebone.com).

Additional Information
--------------------

This project requires no password or further explanation. Please look here in future projects for explanations of actions or required credentials.

### Outside Dependencies and Citation

The following items were included for attached rationale:

	
 
##**[Bootstrap GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)**
	
> Utilizing the Bootstrap Framework gave me the opportunity to uniformly present information within my site. Its requisite theme from CSS is also represented below as a utilized dependency. The color mapping, sized character depictions, and quick implementation of anchored areas are unparallelled for a fledgling designer. 
	
 ##**[Bootstrap Theme](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)**
 
> I don't have the luxury of time/experience to create eye pleasing color palates, and functional design.  Twitter is generous enough to provide these under reusable  licensing terms. I altered them (within the confines of the licensing structure) to facilitate features/color schemes within my design.  I've listed this separately due to its alteration within Licensing. 


##**[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)**

> I utilized the Font Awesome inclusions so that I could use the their fancy Icon Sets. For instance, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Pied Piper are the only icons used in the contact area: doing more with less in terms of visual appeal.Also, there are LESS versions and pre-processing already apparent for efficiency.
