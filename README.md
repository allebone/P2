===================

> **Note:**

> - All of the links and necessary resources are hosted within a Digital Ocean Droplet at the above link (and requisite sub folders). Additionally, the DNS Name Services are provided through the educational assistance program of NameCheap.com. I chose to allow NameCheap to continue to maintain the Name Server control (of forwarding) for the time being, as I didn't want to complicate matters with propagation delay.

Project Description
-------------------

As a class requirement, this project demonstrates the concept of a XKCD style Password. Its usage defines two core prinicples, a easy to remember password, and secondly, a password whose entropy (length of time to automated brute force attack) is infeasible to attempt.  This demonstration, minimally, depicts a choice of number of words you'd like, generates those words randomly from a master wordlist, and attempts to modify it within the confines of your form choices.  Additions of random number, special character, and/or case types allow you to meet requirements for various other password schemes.


Demo Information

### Outside Dependencies and Citation

The following items were included for attached rationale:

	
 
##**[Bootstrap GitHub](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)**
	
> Utilizing the Bootstrap Framework gave me the opportunity to uniformly present information within my site. Its requisite theme from CSS is also represented below as a utilized dependency. The color mapping, sized character depictions, and quick implementation of anchored areas are unparallelled for a fledgling designer. 
	
##**[Bootstrap Theme](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)**
 
> I don't have the luxury of time/experience to create eye pleasing color palates, and functional design.  Twitter is generous enough to provide these under reusable  licensing terms. I altered them (within the confines of the licensing structure) to facilitate features/color schemes within my design.  I've listed this separately due to its alteration within Licensing. 


##**[Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)**

> I utilized the Font Awesome inclusions so that I could use the their fancy Icon Sets. For instance, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub, and Pied Piper are the only icons used in the contact area: doing more with less in terms of visual appeal.Also, there are LESS versions and pre-processing already apparent for efficiency.
